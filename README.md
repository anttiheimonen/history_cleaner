# Bash history cleaner

Bash history cleaner is made to clean bash history of duplicate line and lines, which start with an unwanted word.

## Usage

There is no released executable, but you can clone the repository and build the application with Rust tools.

This is early in development so things may change quickly. Inspect the source code if you want to use this.
